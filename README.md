# Test-1

1.	What does the abbreviation “SCM” stand for.
     - Source Code Management

2.	Alice shares a project repository on a Github server with Bob. Bob lets Alice know that he made some changes to several files. Alice now does a pull from the server. She looks at the files in her working folder but sees no changes. What other operation must she do so that the changed files appear in the working folder?
     - She should commit the changes to the changed files so that it appers in the working folder.

3.	Alice starts working on her project. "I don't need a revision control system", she says, "I'm working alone". State two reasons that she should use something like Github to manage her source code files.
     - It allows you to work on code with anyone from anywhere.
     - Many employers use Github, so if Alice is looking for a job she'll look good for already knowing how to use Github.

  4.	Describe the difference between “Git” and “Github”?
       - Github runs on Git. Git is the main version-control system that Github runs on.

5.	Describe one situation where Alice and Bob would want to work on a separate branch instead of the default branch (a.k.a. the “main” or “trunk”).
  - They would want to work on a separate branch becasue they can make changes to their code and then add it to the "main".
